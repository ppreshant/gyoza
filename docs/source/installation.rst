Installation
============

Install requirements
--------------------

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Linux

       Open a terminal.

    .. tab:: Mac OSX

       If your Mac is equipped with an Intel processor, simply open a terminal.

       If your Mac is equipped with Apple silicon (M1/M2/M3), you may need to
       `install Rosetta <https://support.apple.com/en-ca/102527>`__ first, then   
       open a terminal.

    .. tab:: Windows

       Install WSL2 (`WSL installation instructions <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`__)
       , then open a WSL2 terminal.

1. Make sure you have ``conda>=24.9.1`` (see `Conda documentation
   <https://conda.io/docs/index.html>`__). Proceed to step 2 or 3 accordingly.
2. To update ``conda``: ``conda update -n base -c defaults conda
   --repodata-fn=repodata.json``, or ``mamba update conda``. If you have multiple
   instances of ``conda`` and want to uninstall, say, Anaconda, run ``rm -rf anaconda3``.
3. To install Miniforge (``conda``), follow the instructions listed in the “Step **1b**\ ”
   section of `this tutorial
   <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/setup.html#step-1b-installing-miniforge>`__.
4. Install ``uv``: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
5. Create a Python>=3.12 virtual environment to install dependencies. The specified
   Python version should automatically be installed if not available locally.

::

    uv venv gyoza_env --python 3.13
    source gyoza_env/bin/activate
    uv pip install "snakedeploy==0.15.0" "snakemake==9.14.0" "snakemake-wrapper-utils==0.8.0" "snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm" pygments setuptools

Whenever ``gyoza_env`` is activated, you should see it in the prompt:

::

    (gyoza_env) <USER>@<MACHINE>

If another env is displayed, e.g. ``(base)``, make sure to deactivate it so that there is
only ``(gyoza_env)`` left. You may need to run ``conda config --set auto_activate_base
False``.

Deploy gyōza with Snakedeploy (recommended)
-------------------------------------------

The following command line uses `Snakedeploy
<https://snakedeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__ to create a minimal file
tree that will allow you to use gyōza.

It is specific to both the version of gyōza deployed and the DMS project your want to
analyze, and should make it easier to create a repository for improved reproducibility.
Specify a release version tag for the ``--tag`` argument (latest release to use the
latest version of gyōza), or a specific commit to use a development version (advanced).

::

    snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/durr1602/gyoza my_gyoza_project --tag v1.2.0
    cd my_gyoza_project

Clone the repository (advanced)
-------------------------------

This option provides the most flexibility, although should be reserved for advanced
users.

::

    git clone https://github.com/durr1602/gyoza.git
    cd gyoza
